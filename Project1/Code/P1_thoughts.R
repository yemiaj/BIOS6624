Project 1 Class Discussion

4 outcomes: viral load (VLOAD), CD4+ T cell count (LEU3N), aggregate physical quality of life score (AGG_PHYS), aggregate mental quality of life score (AGG_MENT)

Baseline drug use only (year=0)

Per investigator: Adjust for age, BMI, smoking status, education, and race/eth, and adherence

Context:
a)Difference in outcome between hard drug users and non-users could be explained by adherence.
b)If there’s difference by hard drug status and any of the 4 outcomes, can this diff be explained by adherence between these groups?

Per instructor:  
Year 0 (use), Year 1 (not use), Year 2 and above (use)
CD4 and VLOAD range of values missing. Untreated, 300 to 500. Viral load (usually high, number of copies of viral DNA).
Focus on year 2, not year 2 above.
This is an observational, not randomized, study, so we care about baseline values.
The million VLOAD is plausible.
No ranking among the 4 outcomes of interest, they’re all needed.

Per me:
Plot the relationships among the 4 outcomes, especially the CD4 and VLOAD.
Adherence is an important predictor.
If difference in outcomes by hard drug status, can this be explained by adherence.
Take a look at missing data and drop out.
See how reports of hard drugs use changed over time for individual participants

Questions to clarify:
How does adherence tie into all this? See context a) and b) above
